# Profile Page

A place to highlight my professional skills and experience, and to keep a record of projects I have worked on.

## What does it use?

- React (hooks for managing local state, context for managing the language toggle between English/Spanish)
- Material UI components
- JSS for customised styling
- fontawesome for the icons
- react-reveal for animation
- react-scroll for moving to various areas
- react-copy-to-clipboard for copying the email address
- react-particles-js for the background

## Where is the data

The data is stored locally in the database folder and brought into components where necessary via imports/props. The database structure means it is easy to identify portions of text and change them if necessary, and also means the projects folder can be updated as and when.
